# kd_tree
Two .py implementations of the kDTree spatial index.  The first is a general all purpose kDTree and the 2nd is a 2D implementation using ArcPy geometry objects.  The Arcpy version will load a tree based on any feature class items' centroids, and will store field information at each node as specified by a user.
